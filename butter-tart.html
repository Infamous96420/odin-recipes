    <h1>Butter Tarts</h1> <img src="../odin-recipes/images/tart.jpg" width="200">

    <p>Butter tarts are one of my all time favourite sweet treats and have been for many years. I don’t often make them because, to be absolutely frank, I would not rest until I had eaten all of them!</p>
<p><strong>Ingrediants</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li> Pecans and or Raisins(optional)</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li> Apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>Maple Syrup</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Vanilla</li>
    <li>Melted Butter</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Dark Brown Sugar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Instructions</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, add the flour, salt, and sugar. Pulse briefly to combine.Add the cold butter.Process just until you have pea-size clumps of butter, about 8 seconds.Sprinkle the cold water over the mixture.Process just until moistened and clumpy, about 8 seconds.Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times, just until it comes together into a cohesive ball. Pat and knead the dough into a 6-inch disk, flouring and turning the dough as necessary so it doesn’t stick. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.

Take the dough from the fridge and unwrap onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough to about ⅛ inch thick, flouring and turning as necessary so it doesn’t stick. Don’t worry about the shape.Using a 4-inch-diameter cookie or biscuit cutter, cut the dough into as many circles as possible. Line each cup of an ungreased standard 12-cup muffin pan with one of the circles, gently nudging it down into the bottom creases of the pan. The top edge of the dough circle should come all the way up to the top of the cup. Gather the scraps and reroll the dough if you need additional ­circles. Chill the pan in the freezer while you prepare the filling. </li>
<li>In a medium bowl (preferably with a pouring spout), add the brown sugar, maple syrup, butter, egg, vinegar, vanilla, and salt.Whisk to combine.Divide the pecans and raisins (if using), among the pastry-lined muffin cups.Pour the filling into the muffin cups.Do your best to fill them evenly.</li>

<li>Bake for about 25 minutes, until the tarts are golden brown, bubbling, and set.Let cool on a wire rack for a few minutes, then run a butter knife around the edge of each tart to loosen. Let the tarts cool completely in the pan, then remove. Serve at room temperature.</li>
